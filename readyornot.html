                As part of my project 2 class. I was able to choose any topic that related to UX/UI,
                I decided to study the user interface within the game Ready or Not. My goal was to identify user pain
                points and understand how these issues prevent new players from fully experiencing the game

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As part of a freeform, semester-long project covering the research and user interface creation of new
                applications,
                this site went through multiple iterations to achieve ease of use and provide a high level of knowledge
                for users.
            </p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Problem</h2>
            <p>
                With games becoming increasingly more in-depth,
                they need to ensure that the onboarding of players unfamiliar with the genre is
                handled in a way that lets them understand the game quickly but efficiently.

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                While interviewing and watching each user’s personal experience with the game I was able to identify
                major pain points that were affecting the user experience in terms of
                how easily they could understand the game from a newcomer prepositive.
                With this in mind I decided to redo the Ready or Not main menu and include and creatre a help section to
                prevent users from having to go outside the game for information

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Deliverables</h2>
            <h3>Two Resreach Documents</h3>
            <p>
                I wrote two research papers that documented my investigation into the core problem, proposed solutions,
                and the outcomes from the playtests.
            </p>
            <h3>User Surveys</h3>
            <p>
                Using Qualtrics, I created pre- and post-test surveys that were submitted to the college’s IRB for
                review.
                The pre-test survey asked participants about their gaming experience, preferred genres, and general
                familiarity with game mechanics.
                The post-test survey focused on the players’ experiences during the game, highlighting any pain points,
                confusion, or feedback they had on gameplay and engagement.

            <p>
                This was my first time running a research project from start to finish and allowed me to understand all
                the problems that can go wrong with a project as well as how to understand the data I collected and turn
                them into actionable insights.
