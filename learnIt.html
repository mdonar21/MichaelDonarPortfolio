                this app mockup was created to find a usable way for users who are interested in doing their own car
                maintenance to learn and check parts on an all-in-one app.

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As part of a freeform, semester-long project covering the research and user interface creation of new
                applications,
                this site went through multiple iterations to achieve ease of use and provide a high level of knowledge
                for users.

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Problem</h2>
            <p>
                As someone who has had bad experiences with working on cars and finding helpful advice on them. I wanted
                to create a place where people who are looking to learn the basics can not
                only learn but ensure they don’t start projects unprepared. With this I wanted to ensure the program had
                a
                checklist of tools before starting the project as well as ensuring the videos shown to the users are
                high quality and accurate.

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The Learn It mobile application mockup was developed after research revealed a gap in the market. I
                identified a need for an all-in-one app that not only provided a checklist of parts and tools necessary
                for car maintenance but also offered quick and
                timely help to users. Additionally, the app aimed to feature community-generated videos,
                which would be thoroughly checked for accuracy and quality to foster a transparent learning environment.

            <h3>Mockup Sets </h3>
            <p>
                Mockups
                The original mockups for the application. Designed over a 3-week period considering the professor’s
                requirements for the project as well as their feedback.

            </p>
            <h3>Final Protypes</h3>
            <p>
                Using Figma the protypes were created. This time ultiazing the color. 
                As well as incorporating feedback and an improved video playback area and Forum section.

            <p>
                While this was just a class project, I gained significant insight into user context and how to design around specific user needs. 
                I also learned a lot about identifying a demand for new applications and then crafting a solution. I'm excited to share that I'm continuing to develop this app into a functional prototype.
