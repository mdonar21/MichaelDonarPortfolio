                Taking the opportunity to work on a unique project outside of my field, I encountered new challenges

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Looking for ways to branch out of my comfort zone during my second-to-last semester of college, I came
                across a poster for a special topics class in games and simulations. Initially unsure of what the class
                would entail, especially as a UX/UI student rather than a game design major, I ended up having an
                unforgettable experience that opened my eyes to a whole new world of research.

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The central challenge of the class was to use one of the many forms of wargames to educate players on
                complex and often uncomfortable political topics through gamification.
            </p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The use of a wargame utilizing the Matrix Game format helped students easily understand how political
                crises emerge and spiral out of control.

            <h2 style="color:#03A9C9;">What is a Matrix Game</h2>
            <p>
                <em>“Matrix games are different from traditional wargames and role-playing games. In those, you compare
                    lists of statistics and sift through complicated rulebooks. In a Matrix Game, you simply explain why
                    something should happen, the Umpire determines the likelihood, and you roll a die. If you can say,
                    ‘This happens, for the following reasons…’—you can play a Matrix Game.”</em> – Tom Mouat, Map
                Symbols

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#03A9C9;">My Role in Design</h2>
            <p>
                In the early stages, my primary role was world-building—helping create the fictional setting and lore of
                the game. Once that was complete, I moved on to helping develop deliverables.

            <h3>Player Guide</h3>
            <p>
                I proposed the creation of a player guide as an essential learning tool to explain how to play the game.
                This booklet included the fictional background of the island nation of Takodana and explained the rules
                and mechanics of Matrix Games in an accessible way.
            </p>

            <h3>Map</h3>
            <p>
                Using Figma, I designed the game board—a digital map of the fictional island. We chose a digital format
                over physical to make the game easier to distribute and download for players.
