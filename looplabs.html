            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a group of three, we explored ways to increase student engagement within the student union. We did
                this by utilizing music creation programs
                in a method that could be reusable and expandable for future events.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The Student Union has often been seen as an afterthought within the university, offering not much
                outside of the usual quiet workplace for students to work.
                While a piano is available, we wish to bring a project that offers a lower barrier to entry.

            </p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Resreach</h2>
            <p>
                For our research, we began by analyzing similar music creation apps and JavaScript tools to ensure the
                project's feasibility within the timeframe. This included studying soundboard applications controlled
                via keyboard, as well as Windows programs offering comparable features. Following this digital
                exploration, we then focused on adapting the project into a physical installation at the student union.
                Our plan involved leveraging existing projectors, speakers, and tables to create a MIDI-based sound
                system for user interaction.

                Our market analysis revealed significant gaps in current digital and physical music experiences.
                We looked at intuitive sound control tools such as Bleep Drum,
                Kaoss Pad, Patatap, and Bloom, noting that they often lack integration or require subscriptions.
                Finally, interactive exhibits like Studio KÃ¤mp and Supersynthesis demonstrated a strong demand for
                immersive art but didn't support in-person musical collaboration with advanced features.
                Loop Labs aims to bridge these gaps. Our goal is to combine public interactivity, live sound
                manipulation, and accessible design into a single, hybrid platform that offers a unique and engaging
                music creation experience.

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Loop Labs. A simple, yet powerful music-making device. With this application we wanted a way for
                students to get toghter and make music that would be heard all over the college not just in the union
                through a simple yet powerful music creation tool.

            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Deliverables</h2>
            <h3>Project Proposal </h3>
            <p>
                The 2 project proposals are one written at the start of the project and one written at the final of the
                project.
            </p>
            <h3>Website On Github </h3>
            <p>
                For this college project, GitHub Pages was chosen for deployment. This platform ensures both longevity
                and facilitates long-term collaboration.

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 style="color:#00bcd4;">Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                While the project for class is finished,
                I could see Loop labs being used in the college or elsewhere as a fun and engaging way to increase user
                engagement in a shared environment.
